# Individual-Project
## DAJP1-9-2022: On-line teaching simulation / visualisation

This project is currently a simple prototype designed for me to test the following:
- Drawing an oscilloscope esque diagram on a HTML Canvas with moving sineusodial waves
- Allowing the user to interact with an argand diagram to select the sine wave
- Testing github page hosting for demonstrating progress with this project

This concept was decided upon as regardless of the specific simulation chosen it will be required to dynamically draw content on a canvas.

# Changlog
## [0.3.0] - 2022/10/09
### Added
- Argand diagram, allowing the user to select Amplitude and Phase from the graph
- Ability for the user to select the desired phase of sine wave.

### Known Issues
- Phase is not correct with the axis displayed, phase is correct with the leftmost point on the graph

### Removed
- Consine and tangent waves to simplify interaction with the argand diagram

## [0.2.0] - 2022/10/08
### Added
- Trig wave viewer
- Sliders to modify trig wave

## [0.1.0] - 2022/10/07
### Added
- Created repository
- Added node to gitignore
- Added licence file
